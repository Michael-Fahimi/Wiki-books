# 📚 Wiki-books 🚀

A showcase of my skills in building cross-platform apps with **Compose Multiplatform** 📱💻🌐!

## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates a **multi-platform application** built using **Compose Multiplatform**, meaning it can run on **Android**, **iOS**, and the **Web** 🤯! It's built with a **Clean Architecture** for organized code, uses the **MVI** pattern for smooth UI updates, and **Koin** for easy dependency management. API calls are handled efficiently with **Ktor** 💨.

This is my way of showing recruiters what I can do in modern mobile and web development 💪.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Used

Here's a breakdown of the cool tech powering this project:

* **Compose Multiplatform**: ✍️ One codebase, native-looking UIs for Android, iOS, and Web!
    * **Code Sharing**: 🔗 Write once, run everywhere (almost)! Saves time and effort.
    * **Declarative UI**: 🧘‍♀️ Easy-to-understand UI code.
    * **Native Performance**: 🚀 Fast and smooth on both mobile platforms. Works great on the web too!
* **Ktor**: 📡 Super efficient for making API calls.
    * **Fast Networking**: ⚡ Quick data fetching.
    * **Smooth Async**: ⏳ Handles network stuff without freezing the app.
    * **Data Handling**: 📦 Easily converts data to and from the internet.
* **Clean Architecture**: 🏗️ Well-organized code that's easy to maintain and test.
    * **Organized Code**: 📂 Different parts of the app have clear jobs.
    * **Easy Updates**: 🛠️ Change one part without breaking everything.
    * **Testable**: ✅ Business logic is separate and easy to test.
* **Model-View-Intent (MVI)**: 🔄 Predictable and easy-to-debug UI updates.
    * **One-Way Flow**: ➡️ Data always moves in the same direction, making things clear.
    * **Stable State**: 🛡️ UI state is consistent and reliable.
    * **Clear Logic**: 💡 Separates UI display from app logic.
* **Koin**: 💉 Simple way to manage dependencies.
    * **Easy Setup**: 👌 Quick and easy to get started.
    * **Clean Code**: ✨ Keeps the code organized without lots of extra setup.
    * **Test-Friendly**: 🧪 Makes it easier to test different parts of the app.
* **Coroutines**: 🧵 Handles tasks in the background without slowing down the app.
    * **Smooth Performance**: 🚀 Keeps the app responsive.
    * **Simple Async**: ✨ Makes complex background tasks easier to manage.
* **Serialization**: ⚙️ Converts data into formats for the web (like JSON).
    * **Safe Data**: 🔒 Ensures data is handled correctly.
    * **Kotlin Friendly**: ❤️ Works seamlessly with Kotlin code.

## 🏛️ How It's Built (The Architecture)

Think of it like a well-organized house 🏡:

* **Presentation (UI)**: What you see and interact with (built with Compose Multiplatform).
* **UI Logic/Domain (Brain)**: The app's logic and how it decides what to show.
* **Data (Storage)**: Where the app gets its information (like from the internet using Ktor).
* **Koin (Helper)**: Manages all the tools and resources the app needs.

## 📱💻🌐 Multiplatform Power!

This project shows how one codebase can power apps on:

* **Android**: 🤖 Your favorite Android devices.
* **iOS**: 🍎 iPhones and iPads.
* **Web**: 🌐 Runs right in your browser!

This means a lot of the app's code is shared, saving time and effort while still feeling pretty native on each platform.

## 🎯 What's the Point?

This project is all about showing you what I can do! It highlights my skills in:

* Building apps for multiple platforms at once.
* Creating well-structured and easy-to-maintain code.
* Making smooth and responsive user interfaces.
* Handling data from the internet efficiently.
* Using modern development tools and patterns.

I hope this gives you a good look at my abilities and my passion for building great software! 😊
