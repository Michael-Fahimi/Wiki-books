# Wiki-books

A showcase of Android, iOS, and Web development capabilities using Compose Multiplatform.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a multi-platform application built with **Compose Multiplatform**, showcasing the ability to share a significant portion of the codebase across **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web**. The project follows a **Clean Architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, utilizes the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** pattern for managing UI state in a unidirectional flow, and implements **Dependency Injection (DI)** using **Koin**. API calls are handled efficiently using the **Ktor** networking library.

This project serves as a portfolio piece to highlight my proficiency in modern mobile and web development practices.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following key technologies:

* **Compose Multiplatform**: A declarative UI framework for Kotlin, allowing for the creation of native-looking UIs that can be shared across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop).
    * **Code Sharing**: Demonstrates a high degree of code reusability for UI and business logic across different platforms, reducing development time and effort.
    * **Declarative UI**: Utilizes a declarative approach to UI development, making the code easier to read and maintain.
    * **Native Performance**: On Android and iOS, Compose Multiplatform renders native UI elements, providing excellent performance and a platform-consistent user experience. For the web, it leverages standard web technologies.
* **Ktor**: A powerful and flexible asynchronous framework for Kotlin, used here for handling API calls.
    * **Efficient Networking**: Provides a clean and concise way to make HTTP requests and handle responses.
    * **Coroutines Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Kotlin Coroutines for efficient and non-blocking network operations.
    * **Content Negotiation**: Supports automatic conversion of request and response bodies to and from various formats (e.g., JSON) using plugins like `ContentNegotiation`.
* **Clean Architecture**: An architectural pattern that separates the codebase into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) with clear responsibilities and dependencies.
    * **Separation of Concerns**: Enhances maintainability, testability, and scalability by isolating different parts of the application.
    * **Independent Layers**: Allows for changes in one layer without affecting others, making the codebase more robust.
    * **Testability**: Business logic in the Domain layer is independent of UI and data sources, making it easier to write unit tests.
* **Model-View-Intent (MVI)**: A reactive architectural pattern for managing UI state in a unidirectional flow.
    * **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensures that data flows in a single direction (View -> Intent -> Model -> State -> View), making state changes predictable and easier to debug.
    * **Immutable State**: The Model holds an immutable state, and each user action (Intent) results in a new state, simplifying state management and change tracking.
    * **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The View is responsible for rendering the UI and emitting user Intents, the Model holds the application state and business logic, and Intents represent user actions.
* **Koin**: A lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
    * **Simplified Dependency Management**: Provides a concise and easy-to-use DSL for declaring and managing dependencies.
    * **Annotation-Free**: Relies on Kotlin code for defining dependencies, improving readability and reducing boilerplate.
    * **Testability**: Facilitates easy mocking and testing of components by providing injected dependencies.
* **Coroutines**: Kotlin's concurrency framework for managing asynchronous operations in a structured and sequential manner.
    * **Non-blocking Operations**: Enables efficient handling of long-running tasks like network requests without blocking the main thread.
    * **Simplified Asynchronous Code**: Makes asynchronous code easier to write, read, and maintain compared to traditional callback-based approaches.
* **Serialization (e.g., kotlinx.serialization)**: Used for converting data objects to and from formats like JSON for API communication and potentially local data storage.
    * **Type Safety**: Provides compile-time safety for data serialization and deserialization.
    * **Kotlin Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Kotlin's data classes and other language features.

## Architecture

The application follows a Clean Architecture with the following layers:

* **Presentation Layer (View & Intent)**: Responsible for rendering the UI (using Compose Multiplatform) and handling user interactions (Intents). It observes the state emitted by the Domain/UI Logic layer and updates the UI accordingly.
* **UI Logic/Domain Layer (Model & Business Logic)**: Contains the business logic of the application and manages the UI state (Model). It receives Intents from the Presentation Layer, processes them, and updates the state.
* **Data Layer**: Responsible for handling data sources, such as making API calls (using Ktor) and potentially managing local data. It provides data to the Domain layer.
* **Dependency Injection (Koin)**: Koin is used to manage the dependencies between different layers and components, promoting loose coupling and testability.

## Multiplatform Capabilities

This project demonstrates the power of Compose Multiplatform by running on:

* **Android**: Native Android application.
* **iOS**: Native iOS application (Beta support by Compose Multiplatform).
* **Web**: Single-page application running in the browser (Alpha support by Compose Multiplatform).

This highlights the ability to reuse a significant portion of the UI and business logic codebase, while still providing a native or near-native experience on each platform.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and experience in building modern, scalable, and maintainable multi-platform applications using cutting-edge technologies like Compose Multiplatform, Ktor, Clean Architecture, MVI, and Koin. It demonstrates my ability to:

* Develop applications that target multiple platforms from a single codebase.
* Implement robust and well-structured architectures for complex applications.
* Manage UI state effectively using reactive patterns.
* Handle networking efficiently and asynchronously.
* Utilize dependency injection for better code organization and testability.

This project is intended to provide recruiters with a clear understanding of my technical capabilities and my commitment to using best practices in software development.
